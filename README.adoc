= Fake DNS

This project provides a domain name service that can be used for testing. It is explicitly not the goal that Fake-DNS is used productively.
It serves to support the development of other (dns related) programs.

Should a DNS query return a specific answer or should the query be answered with an error code? Then Fake-DNS is the solution for you.

== How-To

Build and run the software. Make sure you have a JDK 17 installed.

----
./gradlew build
----

Result is in `build/libs/fake-dns-<version>.jar`

----
java -jar fake-dns-<version>.jar
----

== Configuration

Check `src/main/resources/config/application.yml`
The section `app.zones` is the one you are interesed in.
